      <description>Laser Game Revolution is a VR PVP shooter game set in egyptian temples and forgotton catacombs.&#xA;For this project I worked as the lead designer, and lead developper.&#xA;The game was designed for a new kind of experience : Free Roaming in Laser Game venues. As these places have thin walls and obstacles, the game would need to fit very specific configuration of rooms, and environments had to be designed with that in mind.</description>

      <description>Virtual Arena is a competitive PVP sci-fi shooter game. Players compete in an arena in different gamemodes. Player collect weapons and take key areas on the different maps to gain major advantages.&#xA;I worked on designing new levels for 3 different VR venues in France.&#xA;The first map is a big spaceship-like platform designed for a bigger venue. Most of the action is at the center of the arena, with weapin caches located at the edge of the map.</description>

      <description>Escapage is a 20-minute escape game set in a maya environment. Players have to work their way inside a mayan temple and discover the riches of the place, while avoiding deadly traps. The game is designed for 3-8 players.&#xA;I worked on designing a way to condense some of the puzzles into a smaller area, to fit with more configuration of warehouses. I also worked on implementing different types of hand tracking for the newer headset we used (Quest 2 and Vive Focus 3).</description>

      <description>The day after is a Pve zombie shooter game set in an abandoned mansion and a dark village. The game had a moderate success in our VR rooms, and I was tasked to develop a second chapter for it.&#xA;For this game I :&#xA;Wrote the scenario and dialogue lines Designed new enemies and a new boss Designed and developped a more dynamic enemy spawning feature Designed a new level, then tailored it to fit with every room configuration of our venues Optimize the game for low-end vr devices Worked on compatibility for new headset and accessories for the first chapter As the view of players in the game is relatively static, I used impostors to add details in the background without using too much resources.</description>
