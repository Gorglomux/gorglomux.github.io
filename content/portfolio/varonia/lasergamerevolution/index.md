Laser Game Revolution is a VR PVP shooter game set in egyptian temples and forgotton catacombs. 

For this project I worked as the lead designer, and lead developper.

The game was designed for a new kind of experience : Free Roaming in Laser Game venues. As these places have thin walls and obstacles, the game would need to fit very specific configuration of rooms, and environments had to be designed with that in mind. 

Moreover, the goal of this game was  to reach a broader, more casual audiance. The Sci-fi pvp shooter made by the company was too complicated for casual players, and the gameplay had to be fast paced, with less downtime between deaths, little to no learning curve, objects, objectives... 

With that in mind, I settled on having a single weapon, a short death timer, a regeneration system in order to give the player a chance after a tough fight. 
I tried to make it so basic strategies are more efficient than pure skill, as casual players tend to struggle with aiming. 
I also designed game modes for bigger groups of players . 

One very important part of the design experience was to always keep in mind that the walls are real physical objects, which is often hard to transcribe to players in a virtual environment. In order to avoid accidents, there needed to have as little clutter on the walls in the game and little to no walls that exists in the game but not in the real world. I also had to come up with an imaginative way to prevent the players from running too fast, without being too intrusive like in some other games of the same kind. I settled with having a strong black vignetting effect when players are going too fast, which worked surprisingly well and better than a flashing warning and sound effect which were present in similar free roaming games.     


I designed over 40 different maps for most of our venues, and I made a special tool for laser games which allows us to transcribe precisely a physical room, with walls, ramps and obstacles into a virtual environment.
