Varonia Systems is a video game company specializing in making *Free Roaming* VR games. I worked there for 3 years as a Game Designer and Developper.

Free Roaming games are interactive VR experiences, often multiplayer where players can walk around in large spaces (50-1000 square meters) with a VR headset and accessories.
The technology is rapidly evolving, which leads to having games support multiple VR headsets and software configuration. 
I had the opportunity to design games for multiple VR venues, from leisure park to laser games in France and Spain. 

As a Game designer I : 
- Designed environments, levels, Pvp arenas, mechanics, enemies
- Designed a sequel for a PVE game made by the company
- Designed a new easy to learn, accessible Laser Game oriented experience
- Designed accessibility tools for younger audiences
- Design general systems to improve user experience across all games (aiming tools, anti cheat measures) 
- Tailored existing maps or created new maps for new VR venues

As a Game Developper I :
- Developped main gameplay and network features for new games and sequels for existing games
- Worked on older games made by the company to implement new headset and accessories
- Designed and developped a tool made for scanning laser game warehouses, and transcribing them in engine with high precision.


I also helped with QA, Translation and customer support.
