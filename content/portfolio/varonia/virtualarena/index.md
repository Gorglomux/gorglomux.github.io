Virtual Arena is a competitive PVP sci-fi shooter game. Players compete in an arena in different gamemodes.
Player collect weapons and take key areas on the different maps to gain major advantages. 

I worked on designing new levels for 3 different VR venues in France.

The first map is a big spaceship-like platform designed for a bigger venue. Most of the action is at the center of the arena, with weapin caches located at the edge of the map.

The second map is made for smaller venues (2-4 players), and have a more symetrical approach with several doors and pathways blocking line of sight.
