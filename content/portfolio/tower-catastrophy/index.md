It was important to me that the game felt good and cosy to play, therefore I put a lot of emphasis on polishing it by adding particle effects, 
and by taking the time to add basic animation and tweens for the User Interface, Main menu, and background. 

The game is playable on a browser [on itch.io](https://ayperosia.itch.io/tower-of-catastrophe), and the [source code](https://github.com/ThunderJams/GameOffJam2023) is also avaliable on github . 

To get started with the project, I made a [Game Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFU9h1Buusn7iRRbbFxXMZfDTwyCYejdFpgoEXmLpv0) that you can check out.

The project has been developed for the Game Off Jam 2023.
