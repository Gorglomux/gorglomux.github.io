Hi! I'm Armand, and I am a Game Designer and Game Developper from France.
I started game development in 2018, and have been since then working on multiplayer VR experiences, along with several personal projects and school projects spanning across different genres.
I am interested in developping and refining content in games, with a focus on making engaging and replayable experiences . 

In 2021-2023, I worked at Varonia Systems as a Developper and Designer, and I developped my skills as a fully fledged out game developper (more on that [here](/portfolio/varonia)).
I have since then been looking for specializing in Game Design, as I worked on multiple project in this role.

After having graduated from the [CNAM-ENJMIN](https://enjmin-en.cnam.fr/cnam-enjmin-home-1036394.kjsp?RH=1486135978042&RF=1487090762878) in 2023, I am looking for a job as a Game Designer, or Game Developper.

I am experienced with Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot, and love learning about new technologies and engines.
